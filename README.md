# Python_Automated_File_Sorter

In this Python project, I created a program that automatically sorts files into specific folders based on their file types. The program monitors a designated folder for new files, and then moves the files to their corresponding folders based on their file extensions.

To make the program flexible and customizable, the user can specify which file types should be sorted and which folders they should be moved to. The program uses the shutil library to move files between folders, and the watchdog library to monitor the designated folder for new files.

I also added some error handling to the program, so that it can handle situations where the designated folder or the target folders do not exist, or where a file extension is not recognized by the program.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, file handling, and library integration, and shows how these skills can be applied to automate repetitive file sorting tasks.
